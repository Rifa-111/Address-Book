Project Title: Java Address Book

Project Description:
This Java Address Book project is a simple command-line application that helps you manage your contacts. It provides basic functionalities such as adding new contacts, listing all contacts, searching for contacts by name, and deleting contacts from the address book.

Features:

Add Contact: Users can add new contacts to the address book by providing the contact's name, phone number, email, and address.

List Contacts: The application allows users to list all the contacts in the address book. It provides a numbered list of contact names for easy reference.

Search Contact: Users can search for a specific contact by providing the name. If a contact with the given name exists in the address book, the application displays the contact's details.

Delete Contact: Contacts can be deleted from the address book by specifying the contact's index in the list. The application checks for valid index input.

How to Use:

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

Compile and run the AddressBook.java file using a Java development environment or command line.

Follow the on-screen instructions to perform actions within the address book.

Usage Examples:

Add a new contact: Enter the name, phone number, email, and address.
List contacts: Display a numbered list of all contacts in the address book.
Search for a contact: Enter the name to search for and view the contact's details.
Delete a contact: Enter the index of the contact to delete it from the address book.

This project serves as a foundation for a basic address book management system and can be extended with additional features and a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.

Feel free to enhance this project by adding features such as contact editing, data persistence (saving contacts to a file), and improved user interaction.
